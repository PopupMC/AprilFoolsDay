## April Fools Day

A purely cosmetic plugin that modifies quite a lot of packets to the client 
for funny and sometimes mildly annoying effects. Planned to be enabled by 
default for non-moderators and non-admins but to allow anyone to toggle it.

Toggling effects would require to logout and back in.

Normally I would fill out a lot of into here but this is an internal plugin
so maybe later.
